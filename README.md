# web-art-portfolio

///ALL THE ARTWORK BELONGS TO ME AND I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR REUSE.///

This is my expanding web portfolio that will include my artwork aswell!


What I've learned and solved:

1. I've learned animations and what they can do. I've learned about overflow and how to solve excess space. Being able to abuse overflow to configure with animations.

2. I've learned how importance of planning for media queries. I solved it by having to learn the hard way and redoing the whole site from scratch. And the outcome is very rewarding.

3. I've learned using different CSS values and units. Expanding my positioning knowledge.

4. I've learned object fit, so the img will stay the same size even when the width gets smaller.

5. I've learned the !important forces/overrides style rulings. Used it to color the background of the text/form/input area

6. I've kinda learned how to solve putting 2 images in a row. I still need to work on that.

What I'll do next time:

1. Learn grids in css

2. Implement javascript

3. Cooler animations

4. Not include my artwork

5. Not make everything so big

6. Have actual projects linked/included
